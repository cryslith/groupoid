# Groupoid

A discord bot you can be.

## Usage

Invite the bot to your server;
it requires the "Send Messages" and "Manage Webhooks" permissions.

Put

    [groupoid: <name 1>=<key 1>; <name 2>=<key 2>]

somewhere in the channel topic and invoke `!refresh` via DM with the bot.
Now anyone can use `!inhabit <key 1>` to be `<name 1>` and so on.
